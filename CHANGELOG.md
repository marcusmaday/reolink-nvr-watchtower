# Changelog

## 0.4.47

- Fix the Home Assistant notification blueprint import by replacing unsupported `service` selectors with text inputs for notify service ids.

## 0.4.46

- Add per-camera event-type configuration so each participating channel can allow only the event types that matter, such as `PERSON,DOORBELL` for the front door and `PERSON,ANIMAL` for the backyard.
- Enforce allowed event types across event ingest, webhook handling, search results, and the Watchtower dashboard.
- Expand the Home Assistant blueprint to optionally relay `ANIMAL` and `VEHICLE` events for a camera.

## 0.4.45

- Resolve ingested Home Assistant events to the correct participating NVR channel by camera name before building timeline entries and buffered clips.
- Fall back to one-based channel correction for ingest payloads when camera names are unavailable, reducing channel-numbering mismatches.
- Log the enabled camera/channel map at startup so channel configuration problems are easier to diagnose.

## 0.4.44

- Continuously prune rolling-buffer transport stream segments while recording so buffer files no longer grow without bound.
- Include rolling-buffer files in storage maintenance and emergency storage-limit cleanup.
- Add a hard five-minute maximum age for rolling-buffer segments so stale pre-roll files are always removed aggressively.
- Normalize notification links to Home Assistant app deep links and include the specific event ID so "View Event Clip" works more reliably away from the local network.

## 0.4.43

- Hide empty NVR channel slots from the Watchtower camera picker so only real cameras appear in the UI.

## 0.4.42

- Add support for multiple participating cameras, including per-camera filtering in the Watchtower app.
- Add add-on configuration for participating cameras, buffered cameras, and the default live-view camera.

## 0.4.39

- Change the Home Assistant sidebar icon to a clearer camera/security glyph for Watchtower.

## 0.4.40

- Switch the Home Assistant sidebar icon to a plain camera glyph so the sidebar can render it reliably.

## 0.4.41

- Refresh the README screenshot to better match the current Watchtower UI.

## 0.4.38

- Remove the remaining live-view affordance from the app and notification flow so users are no longer sent to a nonfunctional stream page.

## 0.4.37

- Remove the live-view affordance from the app and notification actions since the live stream has not been reliable.
- Keep event playback focused on clips only.

## 0.4.36

- Normalize stale live links back to the app root with `?view=live` so existing events stop opening the dead `/live` path.
- Store the live notification target as the app root query URL instead of a path suffix.

## 0.4.35

- Delay buffered clip finalization until the full before/after window has elapsed so partial clips do not get finalized early.
- Reduce rolling-recorder ffmpeg logging to only surface warnings and errors.

## 0.4.33

- Delay buffered clip finalization until the full before/after window has elapsed so partial clips do not get finalized early.

## 0.4.32

- Make the notification live link point at the app's dedicated `/live` route instead of the query-based live view.
- Add a short dedupe window so the webhook and HA relay merge into one timeline event instead of creating duplicates.

## 0.4.31

- Route live links through the app root with `?view=live` so phones stay inside Watchtower without hitting ingress auth edge cases.
- Keep the app's live page header branded as Watchtower only.

## 0.4.30

- Keep live view inside Watchtower by linking event details and notifications to the app's `/app/live` route.
- Remove the standalone live label from the live page header.

## 0.4.29

- Point the live notification action at the Home Assistant camera dashboard instead of the app live route.
- Remove the standalone "Live" label from the live page header.

## 0.4.28

- Add a lightweight rolling-buffer watchdog that restarts the recorder task if it stops.
- Keep the rolling recorder logs readable by suppressing ffmpeg progress spam.

## 0.4.27

- Respect the configured clip window exactly instead of forcing a 10-second pre-roll floor.
- Silence ffmpeg stats spam from the rolling recorder.
- Align the add-on defaults with the current 1 second before / 15 second after setup.

## 0.4.26

- Rebrand the product to `Watchtower` and rename the repo and add-on slug for the larger HA migration.

## 0.4.25

- Bust cached snapshot previews and force the player to reload the newest event cleanly.

## 0.4.24

- Disable browser caching for the dashboard recent-events fetch so the newest event loads reliably.

## 0.4.23

- Sort the dashboard events client-side so the newest event always loads first.

## 0.4.22

- Force the dashboard to open the newest event on load.
- Remove the dead entry-id deep-link path from the web UI.

## 0.4.21

- Update the add-on panel title to match the app.

## 0.4.14

## 0.4.12

## 0.4.11
